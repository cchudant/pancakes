The original language of the Lorem Ipsum text is called **Sylvarinth**, spoken by the ancient Sylvari people. The Sylvari were known for their harmonious relationship with nature and their skill in weaving enchanting tales. The Sylvarinth language has a unique structure and blends various linguistic elements from surrounding civilizations.

The focus of this lesson will be to introduce the Sylvarinth language, some basic grammar rules, as well as some cultural context for this long forgotten language.

Around 1375 BCE, the Sylvari composed a poem titled "*The Whispering Roots*", which begins with the famous phrase "*Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet*". Let's explore some grammar rules of this language by examining a portion of the poem
Let's analyze the first three lines of the poem:

> *Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,*
> 
> *consectetur adipiscing elit,*
> 
> *sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt...*

Here is the the translation of the first bit of the text: (alternate word meanings are put into parenthesis)

1. *Lorem* *ipsum* dolor __sit__ amet:

- **Lorem** (noun) - wisdom (tree of life)
- **ipsum** (adjective) - hidden (beneath)
- **dolor** (noun) - journey (path)
- **sit** (verb) - to begin (to sprout)
- **amet** (adverb) - together (in harmony)

"Hidden wisdom begins a journey together (Beneath the tree of life, a path sprouts in harmony)."

2. __consectetur__ *adipiscing elit*:

- **consectetur** (verb) - to harmonize (to weave)
- **adipiscing** (noun) - growth (roots)
- **elit** (adjective) - spiritual (connected)

"Harmonizing spiritual growth (Weaving connected roots)."

3. **sed** do *eiusmod tempor* __incididunt__:

- sed (conjunction) - yet (still)
- do (adverb) - sometimes (at times)
- eiusmod (adjective) - fleeting (shifting)
- tempor (noun) - moments (seasons)
- incididunt (verb) - to capture (to embrace)

"Yet sometimes, capture fleeting moments (Still, at times, embrace shifting seasons)."

To better understand the meaning, we have to learn more about the cultural context of this poem.

The Sylvari people deeply revered nature, and their language often had multiple meanings for words, drawing connections between their spiritual beliefs and the natural world around them. These alternate translations showcase how the Sylvari culture imbued their language with a profound connection to the environment, emphasizing the importance of unity and harmony with nature.

The Sylvari people would share this poem at special events and when a new season started. Learning about the Sylvarinth language and the Sylvari culture helps us understand the importance of our connection to nature and the world around us.

## The grammar rules

Now, let's learn three grammar tips using this translation:

- **Word Order**: In Sylvarinth, sentences follow a Subject-Verb-Object order, just like English. However, adjectives usually come after the nouns they describe.
- **Adverbs**: In Sylvarinth, adverbs can be placed at the beginning, middle, or end of a sentence. Their position changes the emphasis of the meaning.
- **Inflections**: Sylvarinth verbs change their form to show different tenses, aspects, and moods. For example, the verb "sit" (to begin) can be changed to "sitar" (began) for the past tense or "sitet" (will begin) for the future tense.
